h1. BBRuby

h2. What

BBRuby is a "BBCode":http://www.bbcode.org implementation for Ruby. It will convert strings with BBCode markup to their HTML equivalent.

h2. Installing

To install as a gem:

  <pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install bb-ruby</pre>
  
To install as a plugin:
  <pre syntax="ruby">script/plugin install git://github.com/cpjolicoeur/bb-ruby.git</pre>

h2. Demonstration of usage

BBRuby has been included directly into the String class for use on any string object:

<pre syntax="ruby">
require 'bb-ruby' # (only needed if installed as a gem)

text = "[b]Here is some bold text[/b] followed by some [u]underlined text[/u]."
output = text.bbcode_to_html
text.bbcode_to_html! # (direct in-place conversion)
</pre>

BBRuby will auto-escape HTML tags, which can be prevented by passing false as the second param. BBRuby can also enable or disable certain tags based on input

<pre syntax="ruby">output = text.bbcode_to_html({}, false)</pre>

You can also choose to only allow certain BBCode tags to be processed.  The following will only process image, bold and quote tags.

<pre syntax="ruby">output = text.bbcode_to_html({}, true, :enable, :image, :bold, :quote)</pre>

You can also disable certain tags from being processed.

<pre syntax="ruby">output = text.bbcode_to_html({}, true, :disable, :image, :bold, :quote)</pre>

Alternately you can access BBRuby directly and not via a string:

<pre syntax="ruby">output = BBRuby.to_html(bbcode_markup)</pre>

BBRuby will also allow you to define your own custom BBCode markup translations or override the built-in translations to be more flexible with your application.  The first parameter is a hash that accepts your custom markup translations:

<pre syntax="ruby">
custom_blockquote = {
  'Quote' => [
    /\[quote(:.*)?=(.*?)\](.*?)\[\/quote\1?\]/mi,
    '<div class="quote"><p><cite>\2</cite></p><blockquote>\3</blockquote></div>',
    'Quote with citation',
    '[quote=mike]please quote me[/quote]',
    :quote
  ],      
}

text.bbcode_to_html(custom_blockquote)
</pre>
